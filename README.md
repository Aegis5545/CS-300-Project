# CS-300-Project
In this project, I was tasked with developing an Advising Assistance Program to manage course data, including prerequisites, and allow users to search for and display course information. I approached the problem by using structures to represent courses and their prerequisites, as well as vectors for efficient data handling. Data structures were key to managing relationships between courses and validating prerequisites.

I overcame challenges like handling file input and ensuring prerequisites were valid by breaking the problem down into manageable functions. This project helped me improve my ability to design modular, scalable software and reinforced the importance of clear, readable code. It has also made me more mindful of writing adaptable programs for future changes.
